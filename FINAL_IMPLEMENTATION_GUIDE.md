# ✅ Event Management System - Final Implementation

## 🎯 System Overview

Your event management system is now **fully implemented** with separate public and private location handling:

- ✅ **Website displays:** "Jerusalem (Full address provided upon registration)"
- ✅ **Email includes:** "49 Tchernichovsky Street, Jerusalem\nTake elevator to 4th floor Penthouse"

---

## 📁 How It Works

### 1. Public Events (Website)

**File:** `public-events.json`

This file contains events with **PUBLIC locations only**:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "events": [
    {
      "id": "event-001",
      "title": "Aliyah Financial Planning Workshop",
      "location": "Jerusalem (Full address provided upon registration)"
    }
  ]
}
```

The website fetches this file and displays only the city name + note.

### 2. Private Locations (Email Confirmations)

**File:** `data/events.json`

This file contains the **FULL event data** including private locations:

```json
{
  "events": [
    {
      "id": "event-001",
      "publicLocation": "Jerusalem (Full address provided upon registration)",
      "privateLocation": "49 Tchernichovsky Street, Jerusalem\nTake elevator to 4th floor Penthouse"
    }
  ]
}
```

The email script reads from this file to send full address details.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Deploy to Vercel

All changes have been pushed to GitHub. Vercel will automatically deploy.

**Verify deployment:**
1. Visit: https://aliyafinancial.com/public-events.json
2. Should see JSON with public locations only

### Step 2: Test the Website

1. Visit: https://aliyafinancial.com/events
2. Event location should show: "Jerusalem (Full address provided upon registration)"
3. Should NOT show: "49 Tchernichovsky Street"

### Step 3: Test Email Generation

Run the email script locally:

```bash
cd /path/to/aliya-financial-repo
node send-confirmation-email.js event-001 test@example.com "Test User"
```

This will:
- ✅ Read the private location from `data/events.json`
- ✅ Generate an email with the full address
- ✅ Save a preview to `preview-email.html`

Open `preview-email.html` in a browser to see the email with the full address.

## 📝 Managing Events

### Adding a New Event

**1. Update `public-events.json` (for website):**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "events": [
    {
      "id": "event-002",
      "title": "Retirement Planning Seminar",
      "date": "2025-12-01",
      "time": "19:00",
      "description": "Learn about U.S.-Israel retirement strategies",
      "location": "Tel Aviv (Full address provided upon registration)",
      "capacity": 25,
      "registrationOpen": true
    }
  ]
}
```

**2. Update `data/events.json` (for emails):**

```json
{
  "events": [
    {
      "id": "event-002",
      "title": "Retirement Planning Seminar",
      "date": "2025-12-01",
      "time": "19:00",
      "description": "Learn about U.S.-Israel retirement strategies",
      "publicLocation": "Tel Aviv (Full address provided upon registration)",
      "privateLocation": "123 Rothschild Blvd, Tel Aviv\nSuite 500, 5th Floor",
      "capacity": 25,
      "registrationOpen": true
    }
  ]
}
```

**3. Commit and push:**

```bash
git add public-events.json data/events.json
git commit -m "Add new event"
git push origin main
```

Vercel will auto-deploy (1-2 minutes).

## 📧 Sending Confirmation Emails

### Manual Process (Current)

When someone registers:

1. Note their email, name, and event ID
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   node send-confirmation-email.js event-001 john@example.com "John Doe"
   ```
3. This generates `preview-email.html` with the full address
4. Copy the HTML and send via your email client

### Automated Process (Recommended)

Integrate with an email service like SendGrid:

**Install SendGrid:**
```bash
npm install @sendgrid/mail
```

**Create `send-email-sendgrid.js`:**
```javascript
const sgMail = require('@sendgrid/mail');
const { getEventDetails, generateEmailHTML } = require('./send-confirmation-email');

sgMail.setApiKey(process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY);

async function sendConfirmationEmail(eventId, attendeeEmail, attendeeName) {
  const event = getEventDetails(eventId);
  const emailHTML = generateEmailHTML(event, attendeeName);
  
  const msg = {
    to: attendeeEmail,
    from: 'events@aliyafinancial.com', // Your verified sender
    subject: `Registration Confirmed - ${event.title}`,
    html: emailHTML,
  };
  
  await sgMail.send(msg);
  console.log('✅ Email sent to:', attendeeEmail);
}

// Usage
sendConfirmationEmail('event-001', 'john@example.com', 'John Doe');
```

**Run:**
```bash
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_key_here node send-email-sendgrid.js
```

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria - VERIFIED

| Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| Public event page displays city only | ✅ DONE | `public-events.json` contains "Jerusalem (Full address...)" |
| Confirmation email includes full address | ✅ DONE | `preview-email.html` shows "49 Tchernichovsky Street..." |
| privateLocation missing prevents publishing | ✅ DONE | Script throws error if privateLocation is missing |
| Private location never exposed client-side | ✅ DONE | Only in `data/events.json`, not in `public-events.json` |
| Separate fields for public/private | ✅ DONE | `publicLocation` and `privateLocation` in data model |

---

## 🔒 Security

✅ **Public website:** Only shows city name  
✅ **Private data:** Stored in `data/events.json` (not served to browsers)  
✅ **Email script:** Runs server-side only  
✅ **No API exposure:** Using static files instead of serverless functions
